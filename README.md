## About

I build reproducible machine learning systems that move from **research → code → evaluation → deployment**. My focus areas: **Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, classical ML** and practical model engineering (training pipelines, evaluation, lightweight deployment).

This README is a curated portfolio intended to present your strongest work clearly and professionally for recruiters, hiring managers, and collaborators.

## Highlights

* End-to-end projects spanning dataset curation, model training, evaluation and inference tooling.
* Strong results in segmentation, NMT and fraud detection experiments (see project notes).
* Comfortable with PyTorch, Transformers, scikit-learn, and production-ready tooling (Docker, scripts, reproducible configs).
